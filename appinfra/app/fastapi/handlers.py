"""Exception handler support for subprocess mode.

Provides base classes and protocols for exception handlers that work correctly
across process boundaries in subprocess mode. The main challenge is that Logger
instances cannot be pickled, so handlers that need logging must use these patterns.

Example:
    from appinfra.app.fastapi import ServerBuilder, ExceptionHandler
    from appinfra.log import Logger
    from starlette.responses import JSONResponse

    class TimeoutHandler(ExceptionHandler):
        async def handle(self, request, exc: TimeoutError):
            self._lg.warning("timeout", extra={"path": str(request.url.path)})
            return JSONResponse({"error": "timeout"}, status_code=504)

    lg = Logger("api")
    server = (ServerBuilder(lg, "api")
        .routes
        .with_exception_handler(TimeoutError, TimeoutHandler(lg))
        .done()
        .subprocess.with_ipc(req_q, resp_q).done()
        .build())
