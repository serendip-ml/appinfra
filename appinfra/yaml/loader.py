Custom YAML Loader with enhanced key handling and include support.

This module provides the Loader class that extends yaml.SafeLoader to:
1. Automatically convert date and numeric keys to strings
2. Support file inclusion via !include tag
3. Detect circular includes
4. Support configurable merge strategies (replace or merge)
5. Validate secrets via !secret tag
6. Resolve paths via !path tag

        Extends the default YAML merge key behavior to support deep merging

        Standard YAML merge (<<: *anchor) does shallow merge - nested dicts
        are completely replaced. With !deep tag (<<: !deep *anchor), nested
        dicts are recursively merged.
