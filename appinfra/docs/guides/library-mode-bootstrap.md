# Library-Mode Bootstrap

Guide to wiring appinfra into any Python entry point that is not a CLI: standalone scripts,
notebooks, embedded clients, in-process factory calls, and full libraries that ship a wheel with
their own default config.

Framework mode (`AppBuilder(...).config.with_spec(...).done().build().setup()`) owns `sys.argv`
and adds a CLI shell on top of the same primitives — see
[framework mode](config-protocol.md#declaring-the-source) for that side. This guide covers
everywhere argv is not the entry point.

## The spectrum at a glance

| Shape                                     | Config surface                        | Section    |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------|
| Script, no config file                    | None — logger only                    | [Case A](#case-a--script-no-config-file) |
| Script with a config file next to it      | `Config.from_path(Path(__file__).parent / "config.yaml")` | [Case B](#case-b--script-with-a-config-file) |
| Script with `App`/`Tool` shape            | `AppBuilder(...)` — framework mode    | [Case C](#case-c--script-with-app-shape) |
| Library that ships a packaged base config | `Config.from_spec(namespace, name)`   | [Case D](#case-d--library-with-a-packaged-base-config) |

Cases are ordered simplest first. A caller reaching the guide starts at the top and stops when
the shape matches.

## Case A — Script, no config file

Runnable file, no config to load, only a logger. `create_root_lg` is enough.

```python
from appinfra.log import create_root_lg

lg = create_root_lg(level="warning")
lg.warning("hello")
```

That is the whole bootstrap. `create_root_lg` returns a configured root `Logger`; no `Config`
object exists in this scenario. Reach for `Config` only when there is actual configuration to
load.

## Case B — Script with a config file

The script has a YAML file next to it (or somewhere on disk) and no packaged `etc/` layout —
typical for one-off jobs, benchmarks, or exploratory scripts. Use `Config.from_path` with the
file path; there is no package identity to spec.

```
my_script/
├── run.py
└── config.yaml
```

```python
from pathlib import Path

from appinfra.config import Config
from appinfra.log import create_root_lg

config = Config.from_path(Path(__file__).parent / "config.yaml")
lg = create_root_lg(level="warning")
```

`ConfigSpec` does not fit here — no config identity, no XDG overlay chain to walk.
`Config.from_path` loads that one file and consults nothing else.

## Case C — Script with `App` shape

The script defines a `Tool` subclass or uses `AppBuilder` to compose subcommands. That path
is framework mode, not library mode — `App.setup()` parses `sys.argv`, resolves the config
via the v1 protocol, and drives the tool lifecycle.

```python
from appinfra.app import AppBuilder

app = (
    AppBuilder("myapp")
    .config.with_spec("myorg", "myapp")
    .done()
    .cli(etc_dir=True, config_file=True)
    .build()
)
app.setup()
```

A script that is not a package works the same way: with no module named after the config, the
base is looked up beside the script, `./etc/myapp.yaml`. Full detail lives in
[config-protocol.md § Declaring the source](config-protocol.md#declaring-the-source). This
guide does not duplicate that surface — reach for library mode only when the entry point does
not own argv.

## Case D — Library with a packaged base config

A library shipped as a wheel with its default config at `<pkg>/etc/<pkg>.yaml`
(per [protocol rule 2](config-protocol.md#2-base-config-ships-in-the-wheel)) is the canonical
target for `ConfigSpec`.

```
my_package/
├── __init__.py
├── etc/
│   └── my-package.yaml
└── ...
```

Downstream construction:

```python
from appinfra.config import Config
from appinfra.log import create_root_lg

config = Config.from_spec("myorg", "my-package")
lg = create_root_lg(level="warning")
```

Two strings: `namespace` (XDG scope) and the config's `name`. `from_spec` builds the
`ConfigSpec`, which locates the packaged base, runs the precedence chain and chooses the
include-authorization root; `Config` then loads the file it resolved to. A spec resolves, it
never loads; the factory is that sequence in one call.

### D1 — Module and filename convention

The module shipping the base is found by mapping the name's hyphens to underscores and
locating it with `importlib.util.find_spec`, without importing it: name `my-package` finds
module `my_package`. The base filename is `<name>.yaml`. Under the standard PEP 8 / packaging
convention (dashed distribution name, underscored module name), both derive from the name with
no further input.

### D2 — Non-conventional layout

Each deviation from the rule-2 layout is one keyword, the same on the spec and on the factory:

```python
Config.from_spec("myorg", "my-package", filename="legacy-name.yaml")  # file name
Config.from_spec("myorg", "my-package", etc_dir="conf")  # directory
Config.from_spec("myorg", "my-package", origin=__file__)  # anchor: this file's dir
Config.from_spec("myorg", "my-package", path="/opt/cfg/base.yaml")  # the file itself
```

`name` still drives XDG discovery: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/myorg/my-package.yaml` is what the overlay
chain probes regardless of the base filename.

### D3 — Accepting user overrides

A library that wants to let its own callers point at an alternate config location surfaces
`etc_dir` and `config_file` as parameters on its own API. `resolve()` takes them as keyword
arguments and threads them into the precedence chain, equivalent to the framework's `--etc-dir`
/ `--config` flags. `Config.from_spec` takes no such flags; this is the explicit form.

```python
SPEC = ConfigSpec("myorg", "my-package")


def load_config(
    *,
    etc_dir: str | None = None,
    config_file: str | None = None,
) -> Config:
    return Config(SPEC.resolve(etc_dir=etc_dir, config_file=config_file))
```

These values MUST come from the caller — a function parameter, a host-application setting, a
constructor kwarg. A library must not read them from `sys.argv` or environment variables on
behalf of its host, per
[protocol rule 5](config-protocol.md#5-library-vs-cli-split).

## Logger configuration

Two shapes for driving the root logger.

**Fixed level, no YAML.** For scripts and libraries that do not want their logger driven from
the config file, `create_root_lg(level=...)` is one call:

```python
from appinfra.log import create_root_lg

lg = create_root_lg(level="warning")
```

**YAML-driven.** For entry points where the config file carries a `logging:` section that
should shape the root logger, load it after `Config`:

```python
from appinfra.log import LogConfig, LoggerFactory

log_config = LogConfig.from_config(config.dict(), "logging")
lg = LoggerFactory.create_root(log_config)
```

This mirrors what `AppBuilder` does at framework setup time. Reach for it when the config file
is authoritative for logging shape; stay with `create_root_lg` otherwise.

Neither `ConfigSpec` nor `Config` fuses the logger into its result — the YAML-driven path above
is a real branch, and a `(config, logger)` return would hide it.

## Packaging as a helper

Library authors typically lift the bootstrap into a package-level function so downstream code
reduces to one call. The helper discovers on the host's behalf, so its docstring says so per
[protocol rule 5](config-protocol.md#5-library-vs-cli-split):

```python
# in my_package/__init__.py

from appinfra.config import Config, ConfigSpec
from appinfra.log import create_root_lg

SPEC = ConfigSpec("myorg", "my-package")


def quickstart(
    *,
    etc_dir: str | None = None,
    config_file: str | None = None,
    log_level: str = "warning",
) -> "Client":
    """Build a client from the resolved config (project-local, XDG, packaged base)."""
    config = Config(SPEC.resolve(etc_dir=etc_dir, config_file=config_file))
    lg = create_root_lg(level=log_level)
    return ClientFactory(lg).create_from_config(config=config)
```

Downstream:

```python
from my_package import quickstart

client = quickstart()
```

appinfra does not ship a generic bundling helper for this pattern — the shape is thin enough
that each library tailors it to the surface its own consumers need (custom context types,
factory signatures, sensible default log levels, additional wiring).

## When to graduate to framework mode

Migrate to `AppBuilder.config.with_spec(...)` when any of these become true:

- The entry point runs from a terminal and end users expect `--etc-dir` / `--config` /
  `--log-level` on the CLI surface.
- The entry point grows subcommands or tools (the `Tool` protocol pays for itself).
- Long-running lifecycle hooks show up: hot-reload, graceful shutdown, subprocess supervision.

For a headless script, notebook, or in-process client construction, library mode stays lighter
and imposes no argv contract on the caller.
