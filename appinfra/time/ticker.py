"""
Ticker system for periodic task execution.

This module provides classes for implementing periodic task execution
with both scheduled and continuous modes. The system supports both
interval-based scheduling and continuous execution patterns.

The ticker system is designed for applications that need to perform
periodic tasks such as:
- Health checks and monitoring
- Data synchronization
- Periodic cleanup operations
- Status reporting
- Background processing

Key Features:
- Scheduled execution with precise intervals
- Continuous execution for high-frequency tasks
- Graceful stopping with cleanup
- Error handling and recovery
- Thread-safe operation
- Status monitoring and introspection

Example Usage:
    import logging

    lg = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    # Scheduled execution (every 5 seconds) with handler class
    class MyHandler(TickerHandler):
        def __init__(self):
            self.lg = logging.getLogger(__name__)

        def ticker_start(self, *args, **kwargs):
            self.lg.info("Ticker started")

        def ticker_tick(self):
            self.lg.info("Tick executed")

        def ticker_stop(self):
            self.lg.info("Ticker stopped")

    handler = MyHandler()
    ticker = Ticker(lg, handler, secs=5)
    ticker.run()

    # Simple callable (auto-wrapped)
    ticker = Ticker(lg, lambda: print("tick"), secs=5)
    ticker.run()

    # Continuous execution (no secs parameter)
    ticker = Ticker(lg, handler)
    ticker.run()

    # Non-blocking mode for mixed event sources
    ticker = Ticker(lg, secs=30, mode=TickerMode.FLEX)
    while running:
        msg = channel.recv(timeout=ticker.time_until_next_tick())
        if msg:
            handle_message(msg)

    Timing mode for ticker execution.

    Attributes:
        FLEX: Flexible timing - fixed-rate from tick start with no catch-up.
              Maintains interval timing but resets if tasks run late. Prevents
              multiple back-to-back ticks. Safe default that prevents runaway
              execution.

        STRICT: Strict timing - maintains average tick rate by catching up if
                tasks run slow. Use for synchronization to external clock.

        SPACED: Spaced timing - always waits full interval from task completion.
                Guarantees minimum spacing between tasks. Use for rate limiting
                API calls or ensuring recovery time between ops.

    Example:
        # Flex mode (default) - maintains interval, no catch-up
        ticker = Ticker(lg, secs=1, mode=TickerMode.FLEX)
        # If task takes 0.2s, next tick at t=1.0 (0.8s wait)
        # If task takes 1.2s, next tick at t=1.2 (0s wait), then resets from there

        # Strict mode - maintains rate, catches up
        ticker = Ticker(lg, secs=1, mode=TickerMode.STRICT)
        # If task takes 1.2s, ticks immediately to catch up, maintains average rate

        # Spaced mode - guarantees spacing
        ticker = Ticker(lg, secs=1, mode=TickerMode.SPACED)
        # If task takes 0.2s, next tick at t=1.2 (1.0s wait from completion)
        # If task takes 1.2s, next tick at t=2.2 (1.0s wait from completion)

class TickerHandler:

    Interface for objects that handle ticker events.

    Defines the methods that ticker-aware objects must implement
    to participate in the ticker system. All methods are optional
    and have default no-op implementations.

    This interface allows objects to participate in the ticker system
    by implementing the lifecycle methods they need. The ticker will
    call these methods at appropriate times during its execution.

class Ticker:
    """
    Periodic task execution system.

    Provides both scheduled (with intervals) and continuous execution modes
    for periodic tasks. Can work with TickerHandler objects to execute
    periodic operations.

    The ticker supports four usage patterns:

    1. Callback-based (using run()):
        ticker = Ticker(lg, lambda: do_work(), secs=5)
        ticker.run()

    2. Iterator (for-loop):
        for tick in Ticker(lg, secs=5):
            do_work()

    3. Iterator with context manager (recommended for signal handling):
        with Ticker(lg, secs=5) as t:
            for tick in t:
                do_work()
                # Stops gracefully on SIGTERM/SIGINT

    4. Non-blocking manual control (for mixed event sources):
        ticker = Ticker(lg, secs=30)
        while running:
            msg = channel.recv(timeout=ticker.time_until_next_tick())
            if msg:
                handle_message(msg)
            ticker.try_tick()  # Only ticks if interval elapsed

    Thread safety: The ticker is NOT thread-safe. Internal state (_first flag,
    _last_tick_time, _api_mode) is not protected by locks. Do not call ticker
    methods concurrently from multiple threads. Do not mix API modes (run/try_tick/
    iterator) even from the same thread - each Ticker instance must use exactly
    one API pattern throughout its lifetime.

    Example:
        import logging
        import threading

        lg = logging.getLogger(__name__)

        # Scheduled execution every 10 seconds with handler
        class HealthChecker(TickerHandler):
