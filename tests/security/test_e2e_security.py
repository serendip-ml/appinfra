    Verify defense-in-depth prevents traversal -> YAML load -> code execution.

    Attack Scenario: Multi-stage attack chain
    1. Attacker uses path traversal to load YAML file outside project root
    2. Malicious YAML file contains code execution payload (!!python/object)
    3. Code execution payload attempts to run arbitrary commands

    Modules Tested:
    - infra/yaml.py: project_root validation, SafeLoader
    - infra/app/cfg.py: Config loading with path restrictions

    OWASP: A01:2021 - Broken Access Control, A03:2021 - Injection

    Security Principle: Defense in depth - even if one layer fails, others
    should prevent the attack. This test verifies that:
    - Path traversal is blocked at the include resolution layer
    - Even if traversal succeeds, SafeLoader blocks code execution
    - Config loading respects project_root boundaries
